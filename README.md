# What is Sundial?

Sundial is a universal mod that allows players to customize their world's day length.

Ever tried to chill and felt like the days were too short?
Maybe you're a speed demon who feels they're too long?
Whatever the case, Sundial has you covered.
You can change day length at any time, to fit whatever mood you're in.

# What does the mod add to Staxel?

Sundial adds two chat commands for players to use:

- **SetDayLength** is an admin-only command that sets in-game day length to however many minutes you specify
- **CheckDayLength** is a public command anyone can use to see how long days are

# What is planned for the future?

As of right now, there aren't any plans.
Perhaps the ability to increase day length and shorten night length, or vice-versa?
Who knows? If you have an idea, do suggest it!

# What does it mean to be a universal mod?

Unfortunately, due to how Staxel is set up, Sundial can't be a server-side only mod.
This means that it's required on both, the client and server.
If playing with friends, everyone who joins the server will be required to have the mod installed.
Sundial will automatically synchronize clients who join with the server's current day length.
